Timezone-US
===========

This is an experiment script I created to know timezone from lat long values, The idea is crated timezone polygons for US and using Point in Polygon algorithm we can check the given latitude and longitude falls under which timezone.

Currently the sql dump I created for only USA, we can add polygons for additional countries.

Thanks.
